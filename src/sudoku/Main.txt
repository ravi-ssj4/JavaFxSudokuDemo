When dealing with JavaFX's Application class and certain build tools or IDEs, there are several potential issues that might arise when launching a JavaFX application directly from the class that extends Application. Some of these issues are:

Class Loading Issues with JavaFX Modules:

Since Java 9, JavaFX is not part of the standard JDK but has been split into separate modules. If you launch a JavaFX application directly from a class extending Application, you might encounter class loader issues where certain JavaFX classes cannot be found. This is particularly true if you're using tools like Maven or Gradle that have their own class loading mechanisms.
Thread Issues:

JavaFX has a specific thread for user interface operations, called the JavaFX Application Thread. Sometimes, launching directly can lead to unintended thread initializations, causing exceptions or unpredictable behavior. By having a separate launcher, you ensure that the JavaFX thread is initialized correctly and at the right time.
IDE Integration:

Some IDEs, like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, have specific integrations or plugins for JavaFX. Launching directly from the class that extends Application can sometimes bypass these integrations, leading to runtime issues or reduced debugging capabilities.
Static Initializer Conflicts:

If your Application subclass has static initializers (static blocks or static variable initializations), these will run before the JavaFX runtime is fully initialized when launching the app directly. This can lead to IllegalStateException errors or other unpredictable behaviors.
Packaging and Deployment:

When packaging JavaFX applications for distribution (e.g., creating a JAR or native executable), having a separate launcher can simplify the process. It can ensure that the Application subclass isn't inadvertently invoked in ways that aren't supported or intended, especially when using tools like JavaFX's jpackager.
Improved Error Handling:

With a separate launcher, you can add custom error handling or logging before the JavaFX application starts. This can be useful for catching and diagnosing startup issues that might be masked or mishandled by launching the Application subclass directly.
